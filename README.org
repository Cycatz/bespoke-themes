Custom medium contrast light and dark themes for Emacs (intended for GUI only, though
basic support in terminal has been added). This started as a fork of [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas
Rougier's]] work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], but has evolved with some ideas and
colors borrowed from [[https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation][material colors]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]] and [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord]].

One of the aims of the theme is to bring much of what is good about the nano-emacs
distro into standard theme formatting, so that it can be set just like any other theme.

The mode line is custom, and may be set as a header line (as in nano-emacs) or as the
normal footer line. Also included is a useful footer line visual alert "bell"
inspired by [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM emacs]].

Faces are basic but fairly comprehensive, including evil cursor colors.

*NOTE*: It is early days for this theme, so there may be fairly significant changes
made in various commits. Pull requests are welcome!


*** Settings
Here's one possible way of setting up the theme. 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package bespoke-themes
  :straight (:host github :repo "mclear-tools/bespoke-themes" :branch "master")
  :init
  ;; Add to load path
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (concat custom-theme-directory "bespoke-themes/"))
    (if (not (display-graphic-p))
      ;; No header line in terminal
      (setq set-bespoke-header-line nil)
      ;; Set header line in GUI
      (setq set-bespoke-header-line t))
      ;; Set evil colors
      (setq set-bespoke-evil-cursors t)
  :config
  ;; Use mode line visual bell
  (bespoke-themes-visual-bell-config)
  ;; Load dark theme
  (load-theme 'bespoke-dark t))
