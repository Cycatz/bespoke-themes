Custom medium contrast light and dark themes for Emacs (intended for GUI only, though
basic support in terminal has been added). This started as a fork of [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas
Rougier's]] work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], but has evolved with some ideas and
colors borrowed from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]] and [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord]]. The mode line may be set as a header line
(as in nano-emacs) or as the normal footer line. Also included is a useful footer
line visual alert "bell" inspired by [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM emacs]]. Faces are basic but fairly
comprehensive.
