Custom medium contrast light and dark themes for Emacs (intended for GUI only, though
basic support in terminal has been added). This started as a fork of [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas
Rougier's]] work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], but has evolved with some ideas and
colors borrowed from [[https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation][material colors]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]] and [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord]].

One of the aims of the theme is to bring much of what is good about the nano-emacs
distro into standard theme formatting, so that it can be set just like any other
theme. The theme is notably less conservative/minimal than nano-emacs (or elegant
emacs), in the sense that it has a broader color palette and set fewer configuration
conditions on fonts and ui elements, but it otherwise shares many of its colors and
themeing ideas.

*OPTIONS*: There is an optional custom mode line, and may be set as a header line (as
in nano-emacs) or as the normal footer line, or the theme can make marely cosmetic
changes (see the options for the =(set-bespoke-mode-line)= variable. You can set
italics for keywords or for comments (or both). You can set variable-pitch for
headlines using =(set-bespoke-variable-pitch)=. There is a toggle function for toggling
between light and dark theme variants: =(bespoke/toggle-theme)=. Also included is a
useful footer line visual alert "bell" inspired by [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM emacs]]. To use include =(setq
set-bespoke-visual-bell t)= in your setup of the theme. All options are available via
=customize-group=, and can also be found in the =bespoke-themes.el= file.

Faces are basic but fairly comprehensive, including (optional) evil cursor colors.

*NOTE*: It is early days for this theme, so there may be fairly significant changes
made in various commits. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

*** Settings
Here's one possible way of setting up the theme. Note that since this theme is
currently not on Melpa the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] setup below utilizes [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] to install
packages, but you can of course install it from this repo however you wish.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package bespoke-themes
  :straight (:host github :repo "mclear-tools/bespoke-themes" :branch "master")
  :config
  ;; Set header line
  (setq set-bespoke-mode-line 'header)
  ;; Set evil cursor colors
  (setq set-bespoke-evil-cursors t)
  ;; Use mode line visual bell
  (setq set-bespoke-visual-bell t)
  ;; Set use of italics
  (setq set-bespoke-italic-comments t
        set-bespoke-italic-keywords t)
  ;; Set variable pitch
  (setq set-bespoke-variable-pitch t)
    ;; Set initial theme variant
  (setq set-bespoke-theme 'dark)
  ;; Load theme
  (load-theme 'bespoke t))
#+end_src

To get windows to divide in the manner seen in the screenshots use the following setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Vertical window divider
(use-package frame
  :straight (:type built-in)
  :custom
  (window-divider-default-right-width 12)
  (window-divider-default-bottom-width 1)
  (window-divider-default-places 'right-only)
  (window-divider-mode t))
;; Make sure new frames use window-divider
(add-hook 'before-make-frame-hook 'window-divider-mode)

#+end_src

To get a splash screen see Rougier's [[https://github.com/rougier/emacs-splash][splash.el]]. You can see my customization of it [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/dotemacs/blob/master/setup-config/setup-splash.el][here]].
